    <span class="modal__form-text">Ice cream is a frozen dairy dessert obtained by freezing the ice cream
      mix with continuous agitation. It contains milk products, sweetening
      materials, stabilizers, colors, flavors, and egg products.<br>
      Ice cream had its origins in Europe and was introduced later in the United
      States where it developed into an industry.<br>Homemade ice cream is
      often made with a base of boiled custard. The mix, with flavourings, is
      poured into a canister surrounded with ice and salt or a refrigerator
      unit. The contents of the canister are agitated by means of a hand crank
      or electric motor until the ice cream is softly frozen.<br>The ice cream
      is usually allowed to harden further in a freezer.</span>

    <span class="modal__form-text">Iced coffee is a coffee beverage served cold. It may be prepared either
      by brewing coffee normally (i.e. carafe, French press, etc.) and then
      serving it over ice or in cold milk or by brewing the coffee cold.<br>In
      hot brewing, sweeteners and flavoring may be added before cooling, as they
      dissolve faster. <br>Iced Coffee is what it sounds like: coffee that's
      been iced. Which means that iced coffee is brewed hot like regular coffee,
      and then cooled down. <br>This makes the taste and consistency of iced
      coffee very similar to that of regular coffee: bright flavors and familiar
      acidity.</span>
